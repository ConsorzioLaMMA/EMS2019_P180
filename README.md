<p>The climate change is affecting Mediterranean Basin more than ever. A recent study of the European Union Science
Hub (JRC) showed that average temperatures in the Mediterranean region have already risen by 1.4°C since the
pre-industrial era, 0.4°C more than the global average. The increased frequency and intensity of heat waves during
summer, especially in the central-eastern and southeastern European cities, has a relevant impact on the health system
and may lead to an increase in heat-related deaths with the greatest impact on urban populations, particularly
the elderly and the ill. This study is firstly focused on trend analysis of summer warm days/night (days with maximum
and minimum temperature higher than the 90th percentile of the daily distribution, i.e. TX90x and TN90p)
and the warm spell duration index (WSDI) for 12 weather stations representative for the main cities along Italian
Peninsula between 1979 and 2017. A nine circulation type classification (SAN09), specifically computed for surface
temperature around Italian peninsula, is used to study the relationship between summer temperature extremes
on regional scale and the frequency variations of atmospheric circulation types (CTs). SAN09 was achieved in a
previous study through the COST733class-1.2 software package, by applying the SANDRA classification method
to the daily geopotential height at 500hPa derived from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis-2 gridded dataset between
1979 and 2015. Either the minimum or the maximum temperature extremes show positive significant trends for
more than a half of the stations, especially for the northern ones and for June. In addition, breakpoints often occur
from the early 2000s, mainly for TX90p, and the frequency of summer WSDI mostly increases on northern Italy.
Four CTs are the most frequent during summer (CT3, CT4, CT7 and CT9) and generally the African high (CT7)
effectively contributes to temperature extremes all over Italy. The Azores high (CT4) mainly produces minimum
temperature extremes (TN90p) on southern-central Italy and maximum temperature extremes (TX90p) on southern
Italy. Azores high with lower values of geopotential height (CT3) is only effective on producing minimum
temperature extremes on the majority of the cities of southern Italy. These results reflect the spatial and temporal
varying response under different CTs due to its complex topography, latitudinal extension and its interaction with
Mediterranean Sea. Seasonal trends in temperature extremes induced by African high (CT7) can be only partly
explained by its increase in frequency, but rather by changing within type properties induced by other long-term
climatic factors.</p>
